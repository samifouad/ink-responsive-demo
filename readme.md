It's designed to show an early stage demo of a responsive ink / react based full screen CLI program

## overview

The program has two components/views that can be switched via pressing tab

If you resize the window, you will see that the program remains full screen

## notes

If you press "q" or ctrl+c ( or cmd+c ) it will gracefully exit and show the previous buffer

This is not optimized, so as it resizes, there will be some jank

This demo is designed to just give someone a starting point to hack away and make something better
