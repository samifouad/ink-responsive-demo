It's designed to show an early stage demo of a responsive [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) / [react](https://github.com/facebook/react) based full screen CLI program

## overview

![an animation showing a terminal window resizing with two sections resizing along with the window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samifouad/ink-responsive-demo/main/demo.gif)

The program has two components that can be switched by pressing tab

If you resize the window, you will see that the program remains full screen

## notes

If you press "q" or ctrl+c, it will gracefully exit and show the previous buffer

This is not optimized, so as it resizes, there will be some jank

This demo is designed to just give someone a starting point to hack away and make something better
